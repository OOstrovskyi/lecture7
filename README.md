# react-conditional-rendering

## Practice task

1. Make a GET request to https://upwork-jobs.glitch.me/profile, while you haven't gotten any response show on the screen `<h2>Loading.......</h2>`, once the server responds you will get an object like this

```javascript
{
    name: 'Brad',
    role: 'Full stack developer',
    hobbies: 'Reading and singing',
}
```

Pass this data into the `<User />` component and display this data when you get the response from the server
